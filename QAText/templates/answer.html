     <p> The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides that the right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
The ultimate goal of this provision is to protect peoples right to privacy and freedom from unreasonable
intrusions by the government. However, the Fourth Amendment does not guarantee protection from all
searches and seizures, but only those done by the government and deemed unreasonable under the
law.</p>
