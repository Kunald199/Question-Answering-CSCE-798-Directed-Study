    <b>  <p> This is a Question Answering System over Textual data. The user inputs query(question) and the model will predict the answer. The answer is predicted from the reference paragraph. The approach used to implement this system is <em>BERT</em> based approach.First based on the query the Retriever returns the relavant document. Then the query and relevant document are passed to bert model to predict the answer. BERT expects input as <em>tokenied inputs </em> and <em>segment id</em>. The tokenized inputs are nothing but the tokenized id of the query text and answer text. The segment id is used to distinguish among the query text and the answer text. </p>

     <!-- <h3> Here are more documents from which you can ask questions too </h3>
     <p> The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides that the right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
The ultimate goal of this provision is to protect peoples right to privacy and freedom from unreasonable
intrusions by the government. However, the Fourth Amendment does not guarantee protection from all
searches and seizures, but only those done by the government and deemed unreasonable under the
law.</p>
