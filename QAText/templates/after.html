    <b>  <p> This is a Question Answering System over Textual data. The user inputs query(question) and the model will predict the answer. The answer is predicted from the reference paragraph. The approach used to implement this system is <em>BERT</em> based approach.First based on the query the Retriever returns the relavant document. Then the query and relevant document are passed to bert model to predict the answer. BERT expects input as <em>tokenied inputs </em> and <em>segment id</em>. The tokenized inputs are nothing but the tokenized id of the query text and answer text. The segment id is used to distinguish among the query text and the answer text. </p>
